# ViridisChai
The app's code is available in 2 forms: A zip file and a folder with all of the files in their respected resporatories.
Everything was created and tested in Android Studio, so to use it Android Studio should be downloaded, then the project should be uploaded, synced and then run. No additional steps should be needed.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project â€” it was built with a lot of care (and learning)!
